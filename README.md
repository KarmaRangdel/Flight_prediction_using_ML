# Flight_prediction_using_ML
This repository contains the flights delays prediction using machine learning classification model. Logistic regression is applied This code contain whole machine learning pipeline.
The provided dataset contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified US air carriers that account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. The data was collected by the Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The dataset contains date, time, origin, destination, airline, distance, and delay status of flights for flights between 2014 and 2018. The data are in 60 compressed files, where each file contains a CSV for the flight details in a month for the five years (from 2014 - 2018). The data can be downloaded from this link. Please download the data files and place them on a relative path. Dataset(s) used in this assignment were compiled by the Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Airline On-Time Performance Data, available with the following link.(https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ)
## Problem statement: Given a set of features, can you predict if a flight is going to be delayed more than 15 minutes?

## Guideline to run code
This code is run on google colab, simply download the .ipynb file and upload it on google colab. Download data from above link and also upload it on colab by clicking on File option. It will give you option to upload dataset zip file. Then install necessary libraries used in code and now you can run code easily.
This code is useful for flight delays prediction as a baseline. However fine tunning and data resampling is required for more better results
